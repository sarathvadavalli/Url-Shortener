# Url Shortener
I completed this project as my 1st task in Code Clause internship. (Python development) 

Overview:
  
  A URL shortener is a tool that takes a long URL and converts it into a short one that redirects to the desired page. URL shorteners prove to be useful in many cases, such as tracking the number of clicks or requiring the user to only type a small number of characters, as long URLs are difficult to memorize. The project is done mainly using 2 modules:
1) 'tkinter' module to create a user-friendly interface
2) 'pyshorteners' module to shorten the entered URL
